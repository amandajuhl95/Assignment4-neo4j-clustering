## Assignment 4

### Neo4j Clustering

You can reuse the demonstrated solution or parts of it to create your own application,
which will consist of:

- a cluster of minimum three Neo4j servers and two replicas
- a software development methodology graph database
- client application, which retrieves information from the database

You should create at least as many queries as is the doubled size of your group. Some of the
queries should provide statistical information, while others must apply algorithms for
traversing graphs, such as similarity, centrality, pathfinding, etc.
You can choose the programming language of your application.

### Our solution

We are currently working on the assignment and will hopefully be able to upload it soon. We have some issues making the three servers since Neo4j is stored different out our OS compared to what our teachers showed in the lesson.
